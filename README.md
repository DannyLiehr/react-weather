# React Weather
An exercise to see if I understand API calls in React. This could use more work.

This react app makes a simple API call to openweathermap and displays current information while using the browser location.

If you wish to try this for yourself, you will need to register on [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/). Then, set your token as an environment variable. The token may not be available for about an hour after you create it.
